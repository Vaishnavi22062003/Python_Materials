
Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. 

It repeatedly compares adjacent elements in a list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

Steps of Bubble Sort
====================

Start at the beginning of the list.

Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.

Move to the next pair and repeat.

After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.

Repeat passes until no swaps are needed (list is sorted).

Selection Sort Algorithm
========================

Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

Steps
=====

Divide the array into sorted and unsorted parts.

Repeatedly find the minimum element from the unsorted part.

Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.

Continue until the array is sorted.

Merge Sort is one of the most important sorting algorithms because it’s efficient and based on the Divide and Conquer technique.

Merge Sort Algorithm:
====================

Divide → Split the array into two halves.

Conquer → Recursively sort each half.

Combine → Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array.
